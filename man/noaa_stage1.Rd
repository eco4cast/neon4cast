noaa_stage1(
  cycle = 0,
  version = "v12",
  endpoint = "data.ecoforecast.org",
  verbose = TRUE,
  start_date = ""
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cycle}{Hour at which forecast was made, as character string
(\code{"00"}, \code{"06"}, \code{"12"} or \code{"18"}). Only \code{"00"} (default) has 30 days horizon.}

\item{version}{GEFS forecast version. Prior versions correspond to forecasts
issued before 2020-09-25 which have different ensemble number and horizon,
among other changes, and are not made available here. Leave as default.}

\item{endpoint}{the EFI host address (leave as default)}

\item{verbose}{logical, displays or hides messages}

\item{start_date}{forecast start date yyyy-mm-dd format}
}
\description{
Access NOAA Global Ensemble Forecast System (GEFS) forecast predictions
at NEON sites. The GEFS is NOAA's longest horizon forecast, extending up
to 30 days at present, issued at 0.5 degree spatial resolution.
EFI downsamples these forecasts at the coordinates of all NEON sites and
provides efficient access to archives of these forecasts in a simple tabular
format for a subset of variables of interest.
}
\details{
WARNING: This combined dataset contains billions of rows. Filtering
to a forecast issued on specific \code{start_date}s or other subsets before
\code{collect()}ing data into R is essential. Be patient, especially on slow
network connections, and handle this data with care. See examples.

At each site, 31 ensemble member forecasts are provided
at 3 hr intervals for the first 10 days, and 6 hr intervals for up to 30 days
(840 hr) horizon. Forecasts include the following variables:
\itemize{
\item TMP - temperature (K)
\item RH - Relative humidity (\%)
\item PRES - Atmospheric pressure (Pa)
\item UGRD - U-component of wind speed (m/s)
\item VGRD - V-component of wind speed (m/s)
\item APCP - Total precipitation in interval (kg/m^2)
\item DSWRF - Downward shortwave radiation flux in interval
\item DLWRF - Downward longwave radiation flux in interval
}

GEFS forecasts are issued four times a day, as indicated by the \code{start_date}
and \code{cycle}. Only forecasts at midnight, \code{cycle = "00"} extend for the full
840 hour horizon. Other cycles 06, 12, 18 are provided only 6hrs ahead,
as mostly being of interest for short-term forecasts. (Though users should
note that other NOAA products provide more much accurate and higher
resolution short term forecasts than GEFS.)

All variables are given at height 2m above ground, as indicated in height.
See https://www.nco.ncep.noaa.gov/pmb/products/gens/ for more details on
GEFS variables and intervals.
